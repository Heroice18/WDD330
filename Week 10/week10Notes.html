    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Validating forms</b><br>
        <ul>
        <li>
          I've used a lot of forms and feedback in my 
          sites when I was a frontend engineer. 
          <br>
      </li>
      <li>
        Having these sets of rules makes it very easy to error 
        check so that the backend doesn't recieve invalid data.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        By setting specific boundaries we can also limit and 
        control what the user inputs into the field.
      </li>
      <br>
      
      </ul>


      <b>Using Fetch</b><br>
        <ul>
        <li>
         We can use fetch to retrieve data over the network 
         such as json or other forms of data to then manipulate onto 
         our webpage.

          <br>
      </li>
      <li>
        We can retrieve or upload data to the server using fetch 

      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
       Using this tool you can have data being sent and retrieved 
       while other aspects of the program are running. 
      </li>
      <br>
     
      <br>
      
      </ul>
