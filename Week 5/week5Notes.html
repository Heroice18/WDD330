        <b>Chapter 8 Forms</b><br>
        <ul>
        <li>
          Forms are really useful for information that 
          needs to be gathered from a user. This can 
          be email, name, phone, etc.
          <br>
      </li>
      <li>
        Forms have inputs, events, and other functions. 

      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        Some common types of form control are:<br>
        input: fields, including text, passwords, check boxes, radio buttons, and file uploads<br>

        select: menus for drop-down lists of options <br>
       
        textarea: elements for longer text entry <br>
       
        button: elements for submitting and resetting forms<br>
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        Forms can also have validation to make sure 
        that all the fields are full or that the input 
        is the right kind of information. 
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        Using the disable property we can make sure that 
        a button or field in a form is not clickable until 
        all the actions neccissary are completed.
      </li>
      <br>
      </ul>

<br>
      <b>Chapter 12 Object-Oriented Programming</b><br>
      <ul>
      <li>
        A lot of objects can have functions associated 
        with them to help the object evolve and grow.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>
      With constructors you can define the object to have 
      a specific set of parameters and variables. While 
      deconstructors remove all the data that's in that 
      object and resets the object.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      Inheritance is when an object can take properties and methods from other objects. 
      <br>
      Polymorphism is when different objects can have the same methods and use them in different ways. 
      <br>
      Mixin is adding methods and inheritance to other objects. 

    </li>
