        <li>
          Error testing, unit testing, and logs are 
          fundamental tools in developing applications. 
          Without them the developers wouldn't be able 
          to identify errors and apply quick fixes and 
          push them to market.
          <br>

      <li>
        There are a lot of tools that can be used to 
        show errors and issues with the program. These 
        can be alerts, info boxes, console logs, 
        exception throwing, and unit tests. 
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        I've used a lot of these tools with my development 
        as such I'm used to all of these debugging tools.
