        <b>The Master Mobile UX Video</b><br>
        <ul>
        <li>I like the part where it talks about designing 
        for the smallest and least powerful device first. 
        In today's market there are so many 
        different types and styles of smartphones, 
        that if you want your product to succeed in the market 
        you need to make sure that the product is able 
        to reach as many people as possible.<br>
      </li>
      <li>
        It's interesting to see the exponential 
        growth of smartphones over the years. 
        I'd be interested to know the different 
        models that helped the growth over the past 
        10 years or so.<br>
      </li>
      <li>
        I like how the video states that if we 
        design for mobile first then we're making it easier 
        to iterate upon the platform in future 
        updates.<br>
        </li>
        <li>
        "Start small and scale up."<br>
      </li>
      </ul>
