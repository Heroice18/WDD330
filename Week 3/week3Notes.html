        <b>Object Methods</b><br>
        <ul>
        <li>
          Using "this" methods is interesting. It's a really
          interesting method to write short hand code and I 
          can see why it's valuable in Javascript.
          <br>
      </li>
      <li>
        Depending on the context of the application, this can 
        refer to text, images, or anything else that is
        passed in or referenced. This can get tricky as the 
        application progresses as the developer needs to
        be aware of what context the application is refering to.

      </li>
      <br>
      </ul>

      <b>Chapter 5 Objects</b><br>
      <ul>
      <li>
        I've used objects a lot for databases and Android
        storage. And it translates pretty well to Javascript 
        as well. 
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>
      hasOwnProperty is an interesting method. Being able
      to check if an object is in the object itself or inheritied
      from another object or function is interesting.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      I've used JSON in all of my Android applications.
      As each of my applications uses Firebase, JSON is what
      is returned when I make a call to the database. I
       find it very useful as it's a way to easily parse
       through data for certain properties.
    </li>
<br>
<li>
I've used Date and Math objects a lot. This is a refresher 
for me.
</li>

    </ul>
<br>
    <b>Chapter 6 Document Object Model</b><br>
    <ul>
    <li>
      I remember using DOM objects a lot in Web Engineering
      1. A lot of this is review for me. 
      <br>
  </li>
  <li>
    I did not know that the CSS could be changed through the DOM.
    I can see a lot of application with this in a site.
    For example, if clicking a button should change the 
    layout to help someone that's physically impaired.
  </li>
  
  </ul>

<br>
  <b>Chapter 7 Events</b><br>
  <ul>
  <li>
    In Web Engineering 1 we worked a lot with events as well.
    So this should be review again. I often use events 
    in Android applications that have a web componet. 
    <br>
</li>
<li>
  Events are not just a thing of Javascript, they are also
   used across other platforms and applications. In mobile
    development, an event listener can be when you tap the screen
     a certain number of times, or tap on an image or element.
</li>
<br>
<li>
  When I was developing a web interface for a project 
  in IEEE we used keyboard events to control an external
   tool.
</li>
<br>

</ul>
