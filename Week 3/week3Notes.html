    <h2>Notes</h2>

        <b>Sitepoint Javascript</b><br>
        <ul>
        <li>After reading a bit I went ahead and followed
            the instructions to download and install Node.js<br>
      </li>
      <li>
        I liked the part on Graceful Degradation and 
        Progressive Enhancement. Making sure that
        a site is functional to a wide variety of users
        is really importnant to make sure that your site
        doesn't go out of date. <br>
      </li>
      <li>
        I like the part where it says, "That is, all old 
        code must work the same way when interpreted by 
        an engine running a new specification" kind of going
        off of the GD and PE from the last point.<br>
        </li>
  <li>
    I think I've never developed a project that didn't
    use arrays. Arrays are a very vital tool for storing
    and manipulating data to fit the application.<br>
  </li>
  <li>
    A lot of good CS 235 material in this book from what
    I can tell. 
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>
    It's interesting how there are so many different ways
    to declare a funtion in Javascript. I didn't know about arrow
    functions until I read the page.
